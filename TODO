- - - - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - - -
  - UI
    - get healthbar to render for turret and base and dirt and stone
      - maxHP
      - render healthbars for non-agents
      - render location
  - turrets
    - only shoot when aimed at target
    - make the smaller turn towards target


- - - - - - - PLAYTESTING - - - - - - - -
  - any monsters attacking base need to be targeted first
  - pacing kinda weird: what to do while waiting for kills?
    cheaper dirt?
  - can get a critical mass of turrets at around 4 farms that kills everything
  - maze is too strong relative to pathing
  - stronger enemies?S
  - if enemies have no moves they should attack dirt
  - ramps up to screen filled with monsters by about 350 killsS
  - splash damage
    - turret, one time use dynamite?


- - - - - - POLISH - - - - - -

  - Remove WASD and scroll (add hotkeys for pause, etc)

  - switch to fullscreen canvas component
  - favicon
