- - - - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - - -
  - UI
    - get healthbar to render for turret and base and dirt and stone
      - maxHP
      - render healthbars for non-agents
      - render location


- - - - - - - PLAYTESTING - - - - - - - -
  - need to prevent accidental drag when you're not touching the screen
  - dynamite needs to be placeable on monsters
  - don't drag with turrets, etc (only dirt)

  - pacing kinda weird: what to do while waiting for kills?
    cheaper dirt?
  - can get a critical mass of turrets at around 4 farms that kills everything
  - maze is too strong relative to pathing
    - enemies ramp up more slowly, but always attack so they don't go through maze?
  - stronger enemies?
  - ramps up to screen filled with monsters by about 350 kills
  - maybe have enemies kill themselves against base so you don't get overwhelmed


- - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - - - - -
  - switch to fullscreen canvas component
  - use ui + utils packages
  - properties
    - add to registry, all named the same way
    - added to memos automatically
  - add levelEditor UI stuff to entities themselves
  - level loading should exist outside of Lobby as a thunk
  - clean up pheromone worker


- - - - - - POLISH - - - - - -
  - UI

  - Remove WASD and scroll (add hotkeys for pause, etc)
  - Remove main menu
  - Reset should pass through lobby again
  - favicon
  - heroku app
